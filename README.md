After installation, you can start using the PumpFun SDK in your applications. Below is a basic example of how to initialize the SDK and interact with the PumpFun Solana program.

### Example Code

```rust
use pumpfun_sdk::PumpFun;

fn main() {
    let pump_fun = PumpFun::new();
    pump_fun.initialize();
    
    // Example of fetching data
    let data = pump_fun.get_data();
    println!("Fetched data: {:?}", data);
}
```

## Examples

### Trading Bot

The PumpFun SDK is perfect for building trading bots. Hereâ€™s a simple example of a trading bot that uses the SDK to make trades based on certain conditions.

```rust
use pumpfun_sdk::PumpFun;

fn trading_bot() {
    let pump_fun = PumpFun::new();
    pump_fun.initialize();

    // Example trading logic
    if pump_fun.should_buy() {
        pump_fun.buy();
        println!("Bought successfully!");
    } else {
        println!("No trade executed.");
    }
}
```

### Meme Generator

Create memes using the PumpFun SDK. This example shows how to generate a meme based on user input.

```rust
use pumpfun_sdk::PumpFun;

fn generate_meme(user_input: &str) {
    let pump_fun = PumpFun::new();
    pump_fun.initialize();

    let meme = pump_fun.create_meme(user_input);
    println!("Generated meme: {:?}", meme);
}
```
